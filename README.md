Asking for the users name and what time they woke up
Peer Review- Marcel R. The program ran well. Asked for two strings which were name and time and output them in a sentence. Solid work :)

Open up the code then press F5, then it will open the localhost, copy the local host and put it into postman. after that type in the controller name, the route, and the input.
